A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
with a similarish feel/flow, only this time we took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like we
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.
